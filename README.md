Expand Don- I mean, Expand Data is a mod that expands the maximum amount of DataTrackers an entity can have attached from 254 to 2,147,483,646.

This is a massive hack, but network usage doesn't appear to be dramatically higher with it, but those tests weren't super scientific so take that with a grain of salt.

I swear I'm not a danger to society guys please just believe me.
